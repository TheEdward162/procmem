# Procmem

Process memory manipulation. Like `scanmem` but mine.

## Progress

- [x] ptrace and procfs support (linux)
- [x] tested by manipulating a game
- [ ] macOS mach kernel support - probably won't finish this
- [ ] Python bindings - very attractive (especially for Python)
	- Probably hard to cross-compile from macOS
- [ ] JSON RPC server - not sure yet, leaning towards no
